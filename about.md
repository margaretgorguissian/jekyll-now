title: Hi, I'm Margaret.
---

I'm a Junior at Tufts University studying Computer Science and Science, Technology,
and Society. I like powerlifting, Indonesian coffee, and rap music. I also enjoy
reading and writing creative non-fiction.

### I try to keep busy.

I work as a Teaching Assistant for COMP 0015, Tufts' Data Structures class. I am
on the board of Tufts Women in Computer Science, and previously served as co-chair
of TUSC Film Series. I write for The Tufts Daily as a Contributing Editor in the
Arts section, and run a bi-weekly, semi-sincere astrology club called Students
Taking Astrology Really Seriously (S.T.A.R.S.).

### I am interested in many things.
Outside of coursework, TA-ing, and lifting, I spend time trying to learn about:
  * Computer security
  * Cyborgs, cyborg feminism
  * The Arabic and Armenian languages
  * Technology and magic
  * Environmental racism
  * Women in the field of exercise science
  * Art in the ancient Mediterranean/Levant
  * And other things...

To see what I have been reading and working on lately, I recommend checking my
favorites tab, or my blog.
