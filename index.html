<h1>Hi, I'm Margaret.</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>I’m a Junior at Tufts University studying Computer Science and Science,
      Technology, and Society. I like powerlifting, Indonesian coffee, and rap
      music. I also enjoy reading and writing creative non-fiction.</p>

<h3 id="i-try-to-keep-busy">I try to keep busy.</h3>

<p>I work as a Teaching Assistant for COMP 0015, Tuft’s Data Structures class. I
   am on the board of Tufts Women in Computer Science, and previously served as
   co-chair of TUSC Film Series. I occasionally write for The Tufts Daily as a
   Contributing Editor in the Arts section, and run a bi-weekly, semi-sincere
   astrology club called Students Taking Astrology Really Seriously (S.T.A.R.S.).</p>

<h3 id="i-am-interested-in-many-things">I am interested in many things.</h3>
<p>Outside of coursework, TA-ing, and lifting, I spend a lot of time trying to
   learn about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Computer security</li>
  <li>Cyborgs, cyborg feminism</li>
  <li>The Arabic and Armenian languages</li>
  <li>Technology and magic</li>
  <li>Environmental racism</li>
  <li>Women in the field of exercise science</li>
  <li>Art in the ancient Mediterranean/Levant</li>
  <li>And other things…</li>
</ul>

<p>To see what I have been reading and researching lately, I recommend checking
  my favorites tab, or my blog.</p>
