title: Baby's First Vulnerability: My COMP 116 Presentation
---

In April of 2018, I discovered a security vulnerability in MedicatConnect,
the software Tufts uses to hold student medical records. The vulnerability
has since been fixed and I was given permission to upload this presentation.  

Special thanks to Ming Chow!
