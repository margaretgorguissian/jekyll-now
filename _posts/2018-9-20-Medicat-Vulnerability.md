title: Baby's First Vulnerability!
---

In April of 2018, I discovered a security vulnerability in MedicatConnect,
the software Tufts uses to hold student medical records. The vulnerability
has since been fixed and I was given permission to upload this presentation. 
  
This was a great learning experience for me, and furthered my interest in 
security. I'm now a participant in bug bounty programs! (Though currently, 
school comes first) 

Special thanks to Ming Chow, who teaches COMP116: Computer System Security
 at Tufts.
